**[Default Prediction](https://github.com/FelipeLRoll/previsao-inadimplencia)**  

![](https://github.com/FelipeLRoll/previsao-inadimplencia/blob/main/imagens/inadimplencia.jpg)

- **Description:**
  
  Default is a critical problem for financial institutions, as it directly impacts the cash flow and financial health of companies. Predicting in advance which customers are most likely to default allows companies to adopt preventive strategies, minimizing losses.
  
- **Objectives:**
  
  This project's main objective is to build a Machine Learning model that is capable of predicting customer default based on a set of financing contract data.
  
- **Results:**
  
  Results can be seen [Here](https://github.com/FelipeLRoll/previsao-inadimplencia/blob/main/readme.md)

**[Fraud Detection](https://github.com/FelipeLRoll/prevencao-fraudes)**

- **Description:**
  
  This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict potential fraud in financial transactions. The dataset includes various features related to loans and customers.
  
- **Objectives:**
  
  The goal is to classify transactions as either potentially fraudulent or non-fraudulent, with the target column being "Possivel_Fraude".
  
- **Results:**
  
  Results can be seen [Here](https://github.com/FelipeLRoll/prevencao-fraudes/blob/main/readme.md)

![](https://github.com/FelipeLRoll/portfolio/blob/main/images/total-energies-start-fia-w-qe117sun9vmq.png)

- **Description:**
  
  In this project, I performed a exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the FIA WEC season from 2012-2023 and Le Mans 2011 Race database.
  
- **Objectives:**
  
  The main objective here is to test and improve my data analysis and uncover insights to some aspects of Endurance Racing.
  
- **Results:**
  
  Results can be seen on the notebook as well as a simplyfied version on the [Readme](https://github.com/FelipeLRoll/wec-analysis/blob/main/README.md)

**[DS Salary Prediction with Streamlit](https://github.com/FelipeLRoll/ds-salary-streamlit)**

![](https://github.com/FelipeLRoll/portfolio/blob/main/images/salary.png)

* There are two versions of this project, one that uses [Flask](https://github.com/FelipeLRoll/ds_salary) and another that uses [Streamlit](https://github.com/FelipeLRoll/ds-salary-streamlit), the streamlit version is more recent and better overall, but i decided to keep both in here.

- **Description:**
  
  This project predicts the Avarage Salary per Month of Data Science Job Listings, included on [this DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilbhathi/data-scientist-salary-us-glassdoor).
  
- **Objectives:**
  * Predict the Avarage Salary per Month of Data Science Job Listings
  * Observing all the relevant columns that affect the salary
  * Testing and selecting the best model
  * Use Flask/Streamlit to build a webapp
  
- **Results:**
  
  * The result for the flask webapp can be seen using the _prediction.ipynb_ class for a quick test, or by using Flask as instructed in the [Readme](https://github.com/FelipeLRoll/ds_salary/blob/main/README.md)

  * Results for the streamlit version can be seen [Here](https://ds-salary.streamlit.app)
